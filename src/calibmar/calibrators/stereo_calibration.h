  // Stereo calibrate two cameras from corresponding planar calibration pattern views of each camera. Allows calibration of each
  // camera by itself and then joint optimization of absolute and relative pose aswell as intrinsics.
  // @param object_points Collection of planar object points (Will typically be the same set of point coordinates multiple times)
  // in world (calibration target) coordinates
  // @param image_points1 2D image observations of the first camera. Must correspond to and exactly match the object points shape
  // aswell as to image_points2
  // @param image_points2 2D image observations of the second camera. Must correspond to and exactly match the object points shape
  // aswell as to image_points1
  // @param camera1 First camera, considered to be the main camera, i.e. origin of the stereo system
  // @param camera2 Second camera, considered to be the secondary camera for which the pose is estimated relative to the main
  // camera
  // @param use_intrinsic_guess If the camera intrinsics should be used as an initialization for optimization
  // @param fix_intrinsics If the camera intrinsics should be considered known and subsequently kept fixed during optimization.
  // This will result in only estimating the absolute and relative poses.
  // @param relative_pose The transformation which transforms a point from the coordinate system of camera 1 to camera 2.
  // @param poses The absolute poses corresponding to each view (i.e. the poses of the first camera)
  // @param std_deviations If requested, contains the estimated standard deviations of each estimated parameter
